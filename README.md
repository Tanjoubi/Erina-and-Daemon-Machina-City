# About
A self-motivated translation project for the upcoming game by coolsister, Erina and the City of Machines (エリナと機魔の都体験版).
The title is currently temporary. If someone suggests a title with more oomph, or if I can think of a better one, it will be changed
accordingly. This project as of today only covers the initial v0.90 demo. No machine-translated tools were used in the making of this patch.

## How To Use English Patch
1. Download latest release.
2. Unzip the patch in the root directory of the game.

## To-Do
1. Translation checking and editing overall.
2. Translation of the content that isn't available in the demo but is still present in the demo files.
3. This repository's README.
